This Java application was created by Connor Betterly for a final project in APCSA. It was last updated on the 5th of June, 2020.

The purpose of this is app is to quickly sort through information collected by our scouts from the Del Mar Regional, and display it
through the use of a GUI. It has been a good learning experience, but in its current state, the project unlikely to be useful in a 
real-world setting; Google Sheets serves our purposes better.

This project took inspiration from Mr. Remington's golf app, and was aided through other general searches, none of which were significant
enough or unique enough to which would warrant a citation.

Thanks for reading the README. I appreciate it.
